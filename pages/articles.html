            From Tech Camp to the IOL (2016)
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            My first experience at the UNH IOL was through UNH's Tech Camp. Tech Camp is a two-week <br />
            summer program where middle and high school students are exposed to research being conducted <br />
            throughout the University. <br />
            <br />
            During the first week of the program, students spend half-day periods covering 14 University <br />
            facilities in order to learn about the research conducted at each. <br />
            Prior to the second week, each student selects their preferred facility and spends <br />
            the remainder of their tech camp experience working in that field. <br />
            <br />
            Intrigued, I chose the UNH IOL, for both years I attended tech camp. At the conclusion, <br />
            the IOL's program director suggested I apply for the internship program., which led to <br />
            being selected as an HighTech Bound Intern, seven years if student employment at the IOL, <br />
            a bachelors degree in Computer Science from UNH, and becoming a UNH Graduate Research Assistant. <br />
            <br />
            This interview details my journey through the process. <br />

            Succeed and Soar in Your Time at the UNH-IOL (2015)

        <p class = "entry">
            During my seven week internship at the UNH IOL in the summer of 2015, <br />
            myself and ten colleagues were asked to compose a letter to future interns <br />
            so they might feel less intimidated upon hire. <br />
            <br />
            After a review period, where the IOL's hiring manager read and commented on each letter, <br />
            my letter was chosen and published on the UNH IOL's website. <br />

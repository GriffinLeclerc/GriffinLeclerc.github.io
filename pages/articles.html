            In June 2017, my colleague, Daroc Alden, and I were asked by the communications department to represent the IOL during The NH 603 challenge, a targeted campaign to raise scholarship funds via a Facebook live post.

            It was UNH's third annual iteration of The 603 Challenge which rallied 4,246 donors who supported more than 150 programs. The effort raised $414,905 during 150 hours of online giving.

            While I was enrolled at UNH, I was contacted by an alumni department representative, and interviewed about my experience at the UNH IOL both as a high school intern and full time employee.

    <div class="grid-item">
        <p class = "entry">
            My first experience at the UNH IOL was through UNH's Tech Camp. Tech Camp is a two-week summer program where middle and high school students are exposed to research being conducted throughout the University. 
            <br /><br />
            During the first week of the program, students spend half-day periods covering 14 University facilities in order to learn about the research conducted at each. Prior to the second week, each student selects their preferred facility and spends the remainder of their tech camp experience working in that field. 
            <br /><br />
            Intrigued, I chose the UNH IOL, for both years I attended tech camp. At the conclusion, the IOL's program director suggested I apply for the internship program, which led to being selected as a HighTech Bound Intern, appointment as a UNH Graduate Research Assistant, and seven years of employment at the UNH-IOL. 
            <br /><br />
            This interview details my journey through the process. 
            <br /><br />

            During my seven week internship at the UNH IOL in the summer of 2015, myself and ten colleagues were asked to compose a letter to future interns so they might feel less intimidated upon hire. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After a review period, where the IOL's hiring manager read and commented on each letter, my letter was chosen and published on the UNH IOL's website. <br />

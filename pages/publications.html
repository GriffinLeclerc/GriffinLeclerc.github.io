                My colleague, Daroc Alden, and I were asked by the IOL's communications department to <br />
                say a few words about the NH 603 challenge for a facebook live post. <br />
                <br />
                In June 2017, UNHâ€™s third annual iteration of The (603) Challenge rallied 4,246 donors <br />
                who supported more than 150 programs and raised $414,905 during 150 hours of online giving. <br />
                <br />

            From Tech Camp to the IOL
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            My first experience at the UNH IOL was through UNH's Tech Camp. Tech Camp is a two week </br>
            summer program where middle and high school students are exposed to research being conducted </br>
            around the university. </br>
            </br>
            During the first week of the program, students spend half day periods at numerous university </br>
            facilities in order to learn about the research conducted at each (14 facilities total). </br>
            At the beginning to the second week, each student chooses which research they most preferred </br>
            and then spends the remainder of the second week at their chosen research facility. </br>
            </br>
            Unsurprisingly, I chose the UNH IOL, for two years of tech camp in fact. After my third year,</br>
            the IOL's program director suggested I should apply for the internship program. And the rest</br>
            is history. </br>
            This interview details my journey through the above process. </br>
            </br>
            The article summarising the interview is avaliable <a href="https://www.iol.unh.edu/blog/2016/08/18/tech-camp-iol" target="_blank">here</a>.</br>

            When I enrolled at UNH I was contacted by a representative of the alumni department. <br />
            I was interviewed about my time at the UNH IOL as a high school intern and full time employee. <br />

            Succeed and Soar in Your Time at the UNH-IOL

        <p class = "entry">
            During my seven week internship at the UNH IOL in the summer of 2015, <br />
            myself and my ten coulegues were asked to compose a letter to future interns <br />
            so they might feel less intimidated when they were hired. <br />
            <br />
            After a review period, where the IOL's hiring manager read and commented on each letter, <br />
            my letter was chosen and published on the UNH IOL's website. <br />
            <br />
            A link to the publication can be found <a href="https://www.iol.unh.edu/blog/2015/09/04/succeed-and-soar-your-time-unh-iol" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />

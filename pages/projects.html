            The focus of masters research: timing protocol performance. Specifically, how the authentication mechanisms introduced by Network Time Security (NTS) effected the performance of networked time transfer when compared to NTPv4.
            <br />
            <br />
            My familiarity with the mechanisms of IEEE 1588 and 802.1AS, thanks to my time at the University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory, enabled me to quickly understand NTP and NTS and begin research almost immediately. <br />
            <br />
            An open source implementation of NTS had been previously developed by Cloudflare and was readily available. By augmenting this implementation, known as CFNTS, with Rust's built-in benchmarking framework, Cargo Bench, we were able to measure discrete time intervals on all machines in the secure time domain and compare their performance to unauthenticated NTP. 
            <br />
            <br />
            This study determines both the performance and scalability of NTS, so two separate experiments were developed to complete each of these objectives individually. The first experiment utilized one client connected to one server in an unloaded environment to measure performance of NTS. The second suite implemented a many-to-one pattern where clients transmitted an increasing number of requests per second to a single server in order to simulate a large network and measure scalability of NTS. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After four months, my academic advisor, Doctor Radim Bartos, and I had completed our research work, the "Experimental Analysis of the Performance and Scalability of Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol". 
            <br />
            <br />
            I am pleased to announce the acceptance of this work into the International IEEE Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control, and Communication (ISPCS), where I presented our findings in Vienna, Austria in October 2022.

            This project is a continuation of the  
            <a href="https://griffinleclerc.github.io/pages/projects.html#tech-camp-2018">UNH Tech Camp Railway Augmentation Capstone (2018)</a>.
            <br />
            <br />
            While the implementation of the original tech camp capstone was a rousing success, it was only used during the 2018 and 2019 summer camp programs. With the cancellation of the 2020, 2021, and 2022 programs, the project remained untouched for approximately three years. During a STEM committee planning meeting, I proposed that the UNH IOL rejoin UNH Tech Camp by offering a summer enrichment program during the summer of 2023. This proposal was accepted and resources were allocated to allow for the creation of a team to develop this program. As the last member of the original development team still working at the IOL, I organized another effort to revive the previous capstone project.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the summer of 2018, I was a rising sophomore and inexperienced in best practices when developing software. All the code used to control the Raspberry Pi's was stored only on the units themselves and not version controlled in any way, requiring users to manually connect to each Pi and control their associated relay individually. Additionally, there was no documentation describing how the Pi's communicated with the relays or which of the relays controlled each electrical signal.
            <br />
            <br />
            The focus of this project was two fold: redesign the existing implementation to implement modern development practices and document the entire system.
            <br />
            <br />
            I lead a team of six junior developers in this effort during the UNH IOL 2022 Summer Hackathon. The existing code was added to a version controlled repository and a new bash library was written which allows users to run simple english commands on a single machine that will orchestrate the entire train control network. Additionally, the project entirely documented within three days of the week long event, so the scope of the project was broadened to include the creation of six logic puzzles designed to demonstrate the knowledge acquired by the campers during the summer program. They would need to complete these puzzles before they could access the train control network.

            This project's goal was to design and construct a low cost, high performance computing (HPC) cluster for use by University of New Hampshire researchers looking to complete experiments involving intense computational components. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The project cluster utilized six rack mounted servers, or nodes, reclaimed by the project's sponsor. These nodes were provisioned with a modern Linux operating system and networked together to form the project's computational cluster. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The project demonstrates it is possible to construct high performance computer clusters using reclaimed technology, while achieving respectable performance at minimal cost.

            In the summer of 2018, I was a volunteer staff member at UNH Tech Camp, a week long summer camp for middle and high school students. The tech camp experience involves a variety of instructors who teach students about various STEM topics. I was the primary instructor during the Computer Science lecture series, where I taught 15 students introductory programming skills. I also supported the Networking and Electrical Engineering segments of the program.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most other UNH Tech Camp programs had concrete deliverables which students could display to their guests at the conclusion of the program to demonstrate what they had learned. For example, the marine biology and ocean engineering departments would teach students about the construction of underwater exploration vehicles. During this lesson plan, students were given the opportunity to construct a miniature submarine using preexisting components and operate it in one of UNH's controlled aquatic environments.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to this physical showcase, parents were able to quickly and easily understand the topics discussed during the program. The same was not true for the Computer Science, Networking, and Electrical Engineering program hosted at the UNH Interoperability Lab. During the end of week showcase, students would often show their parents code they had written on a laptop screen or a basic circuit they had constructed. Parents often had difficulty understanding the topics their child had learned due to this informality.
            <br />
            <br />
            The UNH IOL sought to remedy this situation by developing a pre-built showcase that the students would operate at the conclusion of the program to demonstrate their knowledge. After a few brainstorming sessions during planning meetings, we determined the best course was to augment a model train set using small single-board computers connected to hardware relays. This would allow the campers to easily intercept various currents to the train set and use them to manipulate the trains' movements.
            <br />
            <br />
            We began by familiarizing ourselves with Raspberry Pi's and the <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/arduberry/" target="_blank">Arduberry</a> shield. Six sets of two relays connected to the Pi's performed the following functions: <br />
            Turning the trains on and off by disconnecting the main power to/from the track; <br />
            Increasing or decreasing the speed of the trains by changing the supplied voltage between 5 and 10 volts; <br />
            Changing direction of the trains by swapping the current to each track from + to - and vice versa; <br />
            Changing the direction of three forks by providing an electric pulse to the track's magnetic coil; <br />
            Finally, there was one Raspberry Pi deemed the Master Pi. This Pi maintained ssh connections to the others for ease of access/calibration. 
            <br />
            <br />
            At the conclusion of the program, students successfully displayed their knowledge to their parents and peers during the final showcase event using the augmented train set.

            In early October 2014, I was a Life Scout in Boy Scout Troop 292, Hooksett NH. A few of my colleagues were underway with their Eagle Scout service projects, which included construction of an ice skating hut on the shore of a local pond, and refurbishment of a popular walking path in the town forest. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I wanted to complete a less traditional project that would immediately and directly impact students belonging to low income families whose access to technology was limiting access to learning opportunities. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After some research, and raising $1500 in grant funding and car washes, I contacted the executive director of the Computer Technology Assistance Corporation, a non-profit with a similar mission. They allowed me to use their space over three working days to store, assess, and refurbish 147 computers I had collected from members of the public who donated their older systems. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Of the 147 collected, 82 were made fully functional and ready for distribution, 37 were disassembled for functional components, and 28 were disassembled and recycled. All 82 were distributed at no cost to low income families to support their student's educational experience.

        <p class = "entry">
            Thanks to the website <a href="https://wttr.in" target="_blank">wttr.in</a>, I was able to gather weather data in json format: <br />
            <a href="https://wttr.in/?format=j1" target="_blank">wttr.in/?format=j1</a>
            <br />
            <br />
            This project pulls interesting and distilled weather data in my area and sends it to me each morning via SMTP to SMS translation available from my phone service provider.
            <br />
            <br />
            This project required me to learn how to parse json files, use of external configuration files (ini), bash scripting and crontab (a scheduled execution framework).
            <br />
            <br />
            I decided to use a configuration file for users to specify their location, recipients, and mail server, rather than having to edit the script directly. I then wrote a bash script to first generate the configuration file, request (and wait for) the user to fill relevant information, then execute the weather sending portion of the script using that information. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, in order to protect the user's privacy, the script requires the user to create two system environment variables to access their email address and password. This discourages users from storing their sensitive information in plain text.

            UNH Tech Camp Capstone

                In the summer of 2019, I was a volunteer staff member at UNH Tech Camp, a week long <br />
                summer camp for middle and high school students. The tech camp experience involves various <br />
                instructors who teach students about various STEM topics. I personally led the Computer Science <br />
                portion, where I instructed 15 students about programming basics. I also supported the <br />
                Networking and Electrical Engineering portions of the program. <br />
                <br />
                We began by familiarizing ourselves with Raspberry Pi's and Arduino. Using the <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/arduberry/" target="_blank">Arduberry</a> shield, <br />
                we intercepted various currents to the train set and used them to manipulate the trains. <br />
                Six sets of two relays connected to the Pi's performed the following functions: <br />
                Turning the trains on and off by disconencting the main power to/from the track; <br />
                Increasing or decreasing the speed of the trains by changing the supplied voltage between 5 and 10 volts; <br />
                Changing direction of the trains by swapping the current to each track from + to - and vice versa; <br />
                Changing the direction of three forks by providing an electric pulse to the track's magnetic coil; <br />
                Finally there was one Raspberry Pi deemed the Master Pi. This Pi maintained ssh connections to the <br />
                others for ease of access/calibration. <br />
                <br />
                Students were required to use all of the Raspberry Pi's to complete a timing-based puzzle. <br />
                <br />
                At the conclusion, students displayed their knowledge to their parents and peers <br />
                in an end-of-tech-camp-showcase. Myself and a few colleagues developed this capstone showcase. <br />

            Weather Sender
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            Too long had I been burdened by inaccurate or bloated weather services. <br />
            So I devised a plan, a plan in which I would send myself the weather. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to the wonderful website <a href="https://wttr.in" target="_blank">wttr.in</a>, <br />
            I was able to gather weather data in json format: <a href="https://wttr.in/?format=j1" target="_blank">wttr.in/?format=j1</a><br />
            It was simple once I located the information I was interested in capturing. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to my phone provider for allowing me to sent texts over SMTP, <br />
            I am now able to notify myself of the weather each morning.<br />
            <br />
            In addition to learning more about json, I learned about the use of external <br />
            configuration files and bash scripting.<br />
            <br />
            I decided it best to use a configuration file for users to specify their location <br />
            and recipients, rather than having them edit the script directly. <br />
            I then wrote bash script to first generate the configuration file, request (and wait for) <br />
            the user to fill relevant information, then execute the weather sending portion of the <br />
            script using that information. <br />
            <br />
            Finally, in order to protect the user's privacy, the script requires the user to <br />
            create two system environment variables to access their email address and password. <br />
            This discourages users from storing their sensitive information in plain text. <br />

            Eagle Scout Service Project

            <p class="entry">
                In early October 2014, I was a Life Scout in Boy Scout Troop 292. <br />
                A few of my colleagues were underway with their Eagle Scout service projects. <br />
                These projects included construction of an ice skating hut outide a local pond, <br />
                and refurbishment of a popular walking path in the woods. <br />
                <br />
                I wanted a less traditional project that would immediately and directly impact others. <br />
                <br />
                After some research, I contacted with a representative of the <a href="https://ctac-nh.org/" target="_blank">Computer Technology Assistance Corperation</a>. <br />
                They allowed me to use their space over three working days to store, assess, and refurbish <br />
                the 147 computers I had collected from mambers of the public who had no use for their old <br />
                systems. <br />
                <br />
                Of the 147 colected, 82 were made fully functional and ready for distribution, 37 were disassembled for <br />
                functional components, and 28 were disassembled for raw materials. All were distributed to low income <br />
                families to improve their student's educational expreience. <br />

            My only experience with HTML was in one UNH course, IT 403. <br />
            While it taught the basic principles, requred us to degign a few websites, <br />
            The expreience was limited. <br />
            <br />
            Consequently, I designed this personal website, to showcase my projects <br />

            Universal Task Instructions
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            This is the result of an assignment given in an English class I was enrolled in. <br />
            We were challenged to create a set of instructions that could be given to anyone, anywhere, <br />
            that could be successfully executed without questions from the user. Students were encouraged to <br />
            choose very simple task to ensure instructions remained accessible to all who read them. <br />
            <br />
            I chose to instruct the process of installing an extension for Google Chrome called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Dark Reader</a>. <br />
            It adds CSS to any web page visited that alters light backgrounds to be dark, and dark text to be light. <br />
            <br />
            Through this assignment, I learned that it is very difficult to create anything that is completely universal, <br />
            because no assumptions can be made regarding the knowledge of users. <br />
            After including images detailing the installation process, users were able to complete the instructions much <br />
            more quickly and effectively. I also learned the visual requirements of making effective instructions. <br />
            <br />
            I personally use the Dark Reader extension daily (or rather, nightly) and this website is completely compatible <br />
            with the extension. <br />
            <br />
            If you're interested in following my instructions, the final iteration can be found <a href="../res/projects/Instructions/How to Install a Dark Reader.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />

            Linear Bills

        <p class = "entry">
            A very silly project. I wrote a scrtipt to extend the introduction song of <br />

            A very simple command line Tic Tac Toe game. <br />
            It was written, frankly, because I was bored one evening. <br />
            As it turns out, I was asked a simmilar challenge question <br />
            in an employment interview just two weeks later. <br />
            <br />
            My intent is to use it for a simple introduction to machine learning for myself. <br />
            But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. <br />

            Experimental Analysis of the Performance and Scalability of <br />
            Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol
        </h3>

            At the end of 2021, I decided the focus of masters research: timing protocol performance. <br />
            Specifically, how the authentication mechanisms introduced by Network Time Security (NTS) effected the performance <br />
            of networked time transfer when compared to NTPv4. <br />
            <br />
            Being familiar with the mechanisms of IEEE 1588 and 802.1AS thanks to my time at the University of New Hampshire <br />
            Interoperability Laboratory, I was able to quickly understand NTP and NTS and began research almost immediately. <br />
            <br />
            An open source implementation of NTS had been previously developed by Cloudflare and was readily available. By augmenting <br />
            this implementation, known as CFNTS, with Rust's builtin benchmarking framework, Cargo Bench, we were able to measure <br />
            discrete time intervals on all machines in the secure time domain and compare their performance to unauthenticated NTP. <br />
            <br />
            This study determines both the performance and scalability of NTS, so two separate experiments were developed to complete <br /> 
            each of these objectives individually. The first experiment utilized one client connected to one server in an unloaded <br />
            environment to measure performance of NTS. The second suite implemented a many-to-one pattern where clients transmitted an <br />
            increasing number of requests per second to a single server in order to simulate a large network and measure scalability of NTS. <br />
            <br />
            After a few months, myself and my academic advisor, Doctor Radim Bartos, had completed our research work. <br />
            the "Experimental Analysis of the Performance and Scalability of Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol". <br />
            <br />
            I am pleased to announce the acceptance of this work into the International IEEE Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization <br />
            for Measurement, Control, and Communication (ISPCS), where I will present our findings in Vienna, Austria in October 2022.<br />
            <br />

                This project’s aim was to design and construct a low cost, high performance computing <br />
                (HPC) cluster for use by University of New Hampshire researchers looking to complete <br />
                experiments involving intense computational components. <br />
                <br />
                The project cluster utilizes six rack mounted servers, or nodes, reclaimed by the project’s <br />
                sponsor. These nodes were provisioned with a modern Linux operating system and networked together <br />
                to form the project’s computational cluster. <br />
                <br />
                The project demonstrates it is possible to construct high performance computer clusters, using reclaimed <br /> 
                technology, with respectable performance at minimal cost. <br />
                <br />

                In the summer of 2019, I was a volunteer staff member at UNH Tech Camp, a week long <br />
                summer camp for middle and high school students. The tech camp experience involves a variety of <br />
                instructors who teach students about various STEM topics. I led the Computer Science <br />
                portion, where I instructed 15 students about programming basics. I also supported the <br />
                Networking and Electrical Engineering portions of the program. <br />
                <br />
                We began by familiarizing ourselves with Raspberry Pi's and Arduino. Using the <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/arduberry/" target="_blank">Arduberry</a> shield, <br />
                we intercepted various currents to the train set and used them to manipulate the trains. <br />
                Six sets of two relays connected to the Pi's performed the following functions: <br />
                Turning the trains on and off by disconnecting the main power to/from the track; <br />
                Increasing or decreasing the speed of the trains by changing the supplied voltage between 5 and 10 volts; <br />
                Changing direction of the trains by swapping the current to each track from + to - and vice versa; <br />
                Changing the direction of three forks by providing an electric pulse to the track's magnetic coil. <br />
                Finally, there was one Raspberry Pi deemed the Master Pi. This Pi maintained ssh connections to the <br />
                others for ease of access/calibration. <br />
                <br />
                Students were required to use all of the Raspberry Pi's to complete a timing-based puzzle. <br />
                <br />
                At the conclusion, students displayed their knowledge to their parents and peers <br />
                in an showcase finale. Myself and a team colleagues developed this capstone showcase. <br />

                In early October 2014, I was a Life Scout in Boy Scout Troop 292, Hooksett NH. <br />
                A few of my colleagues were underway with their Eagle Scout service projects. <br />
                These projects included construction of an ice skating hut on the shore of a local pond, <br />
                and refurbishment of a popular walking path in the town forest. <br />
                <br />
                I wanted to complete a less traditional project that would immediately and directly impact others. <br />
                <br />
                After some research, I contacted the executive director of the <a href="https://ctac-nh.org/" target="_blank">Computer Technology Assistance Corperation</a>. <br />
                They allowed me to use their space over three working days to store, assess, and refurbish <br />
                147 computers I had collected from members of the public who donated their old systems. <br />
                <br />
                Of the 147 collected, 82 were made fully functional and ready for distribution, 37 were disassembled for <br />
                functional components, and 28 were disassembled and recycled. All 82 were distributed to low income <br />
                families to support their student's educational experience. <br />

            Weather Sender
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            Too long had I been burdened by inaccurate or bloated weather services. <br />
            So I devised a plan, a plan in which I would send myself the weather. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to the wonderful website <a href="https://wttr.in" target="_blank">wttr.in</a>, <br />
            I was able to gather weather data in json format: <a href="https://wttr.in/?format=j1" target="_blank">wttr.in/?format=j1</a><br />
            It was simple once I located the information I was interested in capturing. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to my phone provider for allowing me to send texts over SMTP, <br />
            I am now able to notify myself of the weather conditions each morning.<br />
            <br />
            In addition to learning more about json, I learned about the use of external <br />
            configuration files and bash scripting.<br />
            <br />
            I decided it best to use a configuration file for users to specify their location <br />
            and recipients, rather than having them edit the script directly. <br />
            I then wrote bash script to first generate the configuration file, request (and wait for) <br />
            the user to fill relevant information, then execute the weather sending portion of the <br />
            script using that information. <br />
            <br />
            Finally, in order to protect the user's privacy, the script requires the user to <br />
            create two system environment variables to access their email address and password. <br />
            This discourages users from storing their sensitive information in plain text. <br />

            Universal Task Instructions
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            I was challenged to create a set of instructions that could be given to anyone, anywhere, <br />
            that could be successfully executed without questions from the user. Students were encouraged to <br />
            choose very simple task to ensure instructions were digestible to all who read them. <br />
            <br />
            I chose to instruct the installation of an extension for Google Chrome called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Dark Reader</a>. <br />
            It adds CSS to any web page visited that alters light backgrounds to be dark, and dark text to be light. <br />
            <br />
            Through this assignment, I learned that it is very difficult to create anything that is completely universal, <br />
            because no assumptions can be made regarding the knowledge of users. <br />
            After including images detailing the installation process, users were able to complete the instructions much <br />
            more quickly and effectively. I also learned the value of visual tools in developing effective instructions. <br />
            <br />
            I personally use the Dark Reader extension daily (or rather, nightly). This website is completely compatible <br />
            with the extension. <br />

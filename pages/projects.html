            The focus of masters research: timing protocol performance. Specifically, how the authentication mechanisms introduced by Network Time Security (NTS) effected the performance of networked time transfer when compared to NTPv4.
            <br />
            <br />
            My familiarity with the mechanisms of IEEE 1588 and 802.1AS, thanks to my time at the University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory, enabled me to quickly understand NTP and NTS and begin research almost immediately. <br />
            <br />
            An open source implementation of NTS had been previously developed by Cloudflare and was readily available. By augmenting this implementation, known as CFNTS, with Rust's built-in benchmarking framework, Cargo Bench, we were able to measure discrete time intervals on all machines in the secure time domain and compare their performance to unauthenticated NTP. 
            <br />
            <br />
            This study determines both the performance and scalability of NTS, so two separate experiments were developed to complete each of these objectives individually. The first experiment utilized one client connected to one server in an unloaded environment to measure performance of NTS. The second suite implemented a many-to-one pattern where clients transmitted an increasing number of requests per second to a single server in order to simulate a large network and measure scalability of NTS. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After four, my academic advisor, Doctor Radim Bartos, and I had completed our research work, the "Experimental Analysis of the Performance and Scalability of Network Time Security for the Network Time Protocol". 
            <br />
            <br />
            I am pleased to announce the acceptance of this work into the International IEEE Symposium on Precision Clock Synchronization for Measurement, Control, and Communication (ISPCS), where I presented our findings in Vienna, Austria in October 2022.

            This project's goal was to design and construct a low cost, high performance computing (HPC) cluster for use by University of New Hampshire researchers looking to complete experiments involving intense computational components. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The project cluster utilized six rack mounted servers, or nodes, reclaimed by the project's sponsor. These nodes were provisioned with a modern Linux operating system and networked together to form the project's computational cluster. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The project demonstrates it is possible to construct high performance computer clusters using reclaimed technology, while achieving respectable performance at minimal cost.
            <br />
            The complete explanation of the project methodology, performance benchmarking, and conclusions can be found <a href="../res/projects/hpc_poster_draft_7.0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. <br/>
            <br />
            This project was presented as part of the University of New Hampshire's Undergraduate Research Conference, <br />
            as well as submitted to the PEARC 2021 conference and presented to the Northeast Cyberteam.

            In the summer of 2019, I was a volunteer staff member at UNH Tech Camp, a week long summer camp for middle and high school students. The tech camp experience involves a variety of instructors who teach students about various STEM topics. I led the Computer Science portion, where I instructed 15 students about programming basics. I also supported the Networking and Electrical Engineering segments of the program. 
            <br />
            <br />
            We began by familiarizing ourselves with Raspberry Pi's and Arduino. Using the <a href="https://www.dexterindustries.com/arduberry/" target="_blank">Arduberry</a> shield, we intercepted various currents to a train set and used them to manipulate the trains' movements. Six sets of two relays connected to the Pi's performed the following functions: <br />
            Turning the trains on and off by disconnecting the main power to/from the track; <br />
            Increasing or decreasing the speed of the trains by changing the supplied voltage between 5 and 10 volts; <br />
            Changing direction of the trains by swapping the current to each track from + to - and vice versa; <br />
            Changing the direction of three forks by providing an electric pulse to the track's magnetic coil; <br />
            Finally, there was one Raspberry Pi deemed the Master Pi. This Pi maintained ssh connections to the <br />
            others for ease of access/calibration. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The final challenge required campers to use all of the Raspberry Pi's to complete a timing-based puzzle. 
            <br />
            <br />
            At the conclusion, students displayed their knowledge to their parents and peers in an showcase finale. A team of IOL employees, including myself, developed this capstone showcase.

            In early October 2014, I was a Life Scout in Boy Scout Troop 292, Hooksett NH. A few of my colleagues were underway with their Eagle Scout service projects, which included construction of an ice skating hut on the shore of a local pond, and refurbishment of a popular walking path in the town forest. 
            <br />
            <br />
            I wanted to complete a less traditional project that would immediately and directly impact students belonging to low income families whose access to technology was limiting access to learning opportunities. 
            <br />
            <br />
            After some research, and raising $1500 in grant funding and car washes, I contacted the executive director of the <a href="https://ctac-nh.org/" target="_blank">Computer Technology Assistance Corporation</a>, a non-profit with a similar mission. They allowed me to use their space over three working days to store, assess, and refurbish 147 computers I had collected from members of the public who donated their older systems. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Of the 147 collected, 82 were made fully functional and ready for distribution, 37 were disassembled for functional components, and 28 were disassembled and recycled. All 82 were distributed at no cost to low income families to support their student's educational experience.

            My HTML knowledge was limited to a single introductory college course. While I learned basic HTML design principles, the experience was limited. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Consequently, I designed this personal website to showcase my experience, projects, publications, and awards that cannot be included on a resume of reasonable size.

            In October 2022, I conducted a website redesign using <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout" target="_blank">CSS Grid</a>. GriffinLeclerc.github.io now supports mobile device browsing as well as 4k displays.

        <p class = "entry">
            Thanks to the website <a href="https://wttr.in" target="_blank">wttr.in</a>, I was able to gather weather data in json format: <br />
            <a href="https://wttr.in/?format=j1" target="_blank">wttr.in/?format=j1</a><br />
            It was rather simple once I located the information I was interested in capturing. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Because my phone provider for allows sending of texts over SMTP, I am now able to notify myself of the weather conditions each morning.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to learning more about json, I learned about the use of external configuration files and bash scripting.
            <br />
            <br />
            I decided to use a configuration file for users to specify their location and recipients, rather than having them edit the script directly. I then wrote a bash script to first generate the configuration file, request (and wait for) the user to fill relevant information, then execute the weather sending portion of the script using that information. 
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, in order to protect the user's privacy, the script requires the user to create two system environment variables to access their email address and password. This discourages users from storing their sensitive information in plain text.

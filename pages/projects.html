            Weather Sender
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            Too long had I been burdened by inaccurate or bloated weather services. <br />
            So I devised a plan, a plan in which I would send myself the weather. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to the wonderful website <a href="https://wttr.in">wttr.in</a>, <br />
            I was able to gather weather data in json format: <a href="https://wttr.in/?format=j1">wttr.in/?format=j1</a><br />
            And it was simple once I located the information I was interested in. <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to my phone provider for allowing me to sent texts over SMTP, <br />
            I am able to notify myself of the weather each morning.<br />
            <br />
            In addition to learning more about json, I learned about the use of configuration <br />
            files and bash scripting.<br />
            <br />
            I decided it best to use a configuration file for users to specify their location <br />
            and recipients, rather than having them edit the script directly. <br />
            I then wrote bash script to first generate the configuration file, request (and wait for) <br />
            the user fill relevant information, then run the script. <br />
            <br />
            Finally, in order to protect the user's privacy, the script requires the user to <br />
            set two system environment variables to their email address and password. <br />
            This discourages users from storing their sensitive information in plain text. <br />

            My only experience with HTML was in one UNH course, IT 403. <br />
            While it taught us the basic principles, and had us degign a few websites, <br />
            I did not take away much. <br />
            <br />
            So I set asside some time to make this personal website, to showcase my projects <br />
            ad publications as they would not fit on a resume of reasonable size. <br />
            Theres not much sense linking it, because you're already here. However, <br />

            Linear Bills
        </h3>
        <p class = "entry">
            A very silly project. I wrote a scrtipt to extend the introduction song of <br />
            Disney's <a href="https://billnye.com/the-science-guy">Bill Nye, the Science Guy</a>. <br />
            <br />
            Given a number, it repeats an audio sequence of "Bill! Bill! Bill! Bill!" that number or times. <br />

        <p class = "entry">
            A very simple command line Tic Tac Toe game. <br />
            It was written, frankly, because I had nothing to do for an evening. <br />
            <br />
            My intent is to use it for a simple introduction to machine learning for myself. <br />
            But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. <br />

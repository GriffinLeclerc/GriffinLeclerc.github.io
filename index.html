        My name is Griffin Leclerc and, since you are here, you probably wish to know more about me. 
        <br/><br/>
        I am currently a Senior Developer at the University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory (IOL) with leadership and development responsibilities within the Avnu and IEEE 1588 working groups.
        Avnu primarily focuses on Time Sensitive Networking technologies in the professional audio, automotive, and industrial spaces.
        IEEE 1588 focuses on the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and its various profiles. PTP serves to synchronize time throughout a network. My work entails writing and reviewing test plans derived from networking standards. 
        <br />
        In addition, I develop improvements for the IOL's time sensitive networking testing tool, <a href="https://www.iol.unh.edu/solutions/test-tools/violett" target="_blank">Violett</a>. <br/>
        More information about my experience at the IOL is available on my <a href="res/Griffin Leclerc's Resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. 
        <br/><br/>
        I have obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of New Hampshire as of December 2022. 
        <br />
        I have previously obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of New Hampshire as of May 2021.

        Hello and welcome to my personal website! <br/>
        My name is Griffin Leclerc, and since you are here, you probably wish to know more about me. <br/>
        Well fear not my friend, for there is information abound in this place of mine. <br/>
        <br/>
        I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant at the University of New Hampshire Interoperability Laboratory. <br/>
        My main leadership and development responsibilities are within the Avnu and IEEE 1588 working groups.<br/>
        Avnu primarily focuses on Time Sensitive Networking technologies in the professional audio, automotive, and industrial spaces. <br/>
        IEEE 1588 focuses on the Precision Time Protocol and its various profiles. PTP serves to synchronize time throughout a network. <br />
        My work entails writing and reviewing test plans derived from networking standards. <br />
        I also develop improvements for the IOL's time sensitive networking testing tool, <a href="https://www.iol.unh.edu/solutions/test-tools/violett" target="_blank">Violett</a>. <br/>
        More information about my experience at the IOL is available on my <a href="res/Resume Master.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. <br/>
        <br/>
        I attend the University of New Hampshire, pursuing a Masters's degree in Computer Science. Expected December 2022. <br/>
        I have previously obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science as of May 2021. <br/>
